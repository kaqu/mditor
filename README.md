# AI-MD-Editor

A local-first Markdown editor with an embedded AI agent. This repository contains the monorepo for both the Rust/Tauri core and the React UI.

## Branching Model

Active development happens on the `dev` branch. The `main` branch is protected
and only updated from `dev` when releasing. Feature branches should be created
from `dev` and pull requests should target `dev`.
